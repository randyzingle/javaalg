"Welcome to my inn, traveler. You do not seem like one of my ordinary customers.
Here, take a pint and some soup. You seem like one of those adventuring types.
If you want a lead on some opportunities for fame or fortune, I am your man.
For starters, there is a cave of wolves to south of town which has been causing a lot of trouble
for the farmers around here. If you were to clear it out the mayor will reward you well.
Also, from time to time there are some goblins who like to ambush caravans on roadways around here.
Merchants tend to pay well for protection and it doesn't hurt to be on their good side.
The mayor is also concerned about a camp of orcs that has recently appeared in the east.
Clearing this camp would help prevent any raid on the town the orcs might be planning.
If you ever need to stay at my inn for the night your are always welcome for a small fee.
Good luck on your adventures."
